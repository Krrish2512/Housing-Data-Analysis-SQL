# Housing-Data-Analysis-SQL

The SQL Data Analysis project centered on exploring and manipulating data using SQL, with a specific focus on housing information. Through the utilization of SQL, the project aimed to refine the dataset by addressing various data quality issues, including null values, redundant columns, and unstructured data.

**Key Activities:**
- **Data Exploration:** The project began with a comprehensive examination of the housing dataset to understand its structure, variables, and potential challenges.
  
- **Data Manipulation:** SQL queries were employed to manipulate the dataset, refining it into a more structured and usable format. This involved tasks such as:
    - Removing Null Values: Null values were identified and addressed using SQL's filtering capabilities to ensure data completeness and accuracy.
    - Splitting Columns: Columns containing concatenated or composite data were split into separate columns for improved analysis and querying.
    - Dropping Unused Columns: Redundant or unnecessary columns were identified and dropped from the dataset to streamline data processing and analysis.

**Methodology:**
- **SQL Queries:** Data manipulation tasks were performed using SQL queries, leveraging its powerful capabilities for data retrieval, transformation, and cleaning.
  
- **Data Cleaning Techniques:** SQL functions and clauses such as `WHERE`, `CASE`, and `DROP` were utilized to clean and refine the dataset, ensuring data quality and integrity.

**Conclusion:**
Through the application of SQL data analysis techniques, the project successfully transformed the raw housing dataset into a refined and structured form suitable for further analysis and modeling. By addressing data quality issues and restructuring the dataset, valuable insights can now be extracted to inform decision-making processes in areas such as real estate investment, market analysis, and urban planning.

The SQL queries and scripts used in this project are available in the repository for reference and further exploration. Your feedback and contributions are welcome as we continue to refine and enhance our data analysis capabilities using SQL.
